AI Interview Coach – Agile Project Management with Jira 
Project Overview 
This project demonstrates how to manage and deliver a software MVP using Agile Scrum practices in Jira. 

This product concept is an AI-powered interview practice platform that helps job seekers prepare for technical and behavioral interview through AI-generated questions, real-time feedback, and progress analytics. 

Methodology: Scrum [2 weeks sprints] 
Tooling: Jira [board, backlog, reports], GitHub [documentation] 
Velocity target: ~20 story points per sprint 
Scope: 5 epics, 12 user stories 
Backlog: Epics and User Stories 
Epic 1: User onboarding and authentication 

A1 = email and password signup [5 SP] 
A2 = login/logout [5 SP] 
A3 = Google login [5 SP] 
Epic 2: Interview simulation engine 

B1 = AI generated job-specific questions [8 SP] 
B2 = user types answers [3 SP]  
B3 = unique questions each session [5 SP] 
Epic 3: Feedback and analytics 

C1 = AI feedback on answers [8 SP] 
C2 = Progress dashboard [5 SP] 
Epic 4: Subscriptions and payment system 

D1 = Subscription and stripe integration [8 SP] 
D2 = admin subscription dashboard [5 SP] 
Epic 5: Web MVP launch 

E1 = responsive web design [5 SP] 
E2 = landing price with pricing [3 SP] 
Total backlog size = 65 SP 

Sprint 1 Report (Executed in Jira) 
Sprint Goal: Deliver basic authentication and an AI Q&A prototype. 

Stories Delivered (21 SP): 

A1: Signup (5 SP) 
A2: Login/Logout (5 SP) 
B1: AI Questions (8 SP) 
B2: Answer Input (3 SP) 
Process & Daily Updates 

Day 1: A1 (Signup) moved To Do → In Progress. 
Day 2: A2 (Login/Logout) moved To Do → In Progress. 
Day 3: QA bug found in signup → A1 moved back to In Progress. 
Day 5: B1 (AI Questions) blocked due to API quota → flagged in Jira. 
Day 6: Blocker resolved → B1 unblocked and continued. 
Day 7: B2 (Answer Input) started. 
Day 10: All Sprint 1 stories moved to Done. 
Daily comments & blockers were logged in Jira to simulate real team activity. 

Jira Reports 
Burndown Chart: Showed a gradual decline with a dip around Day 5 due to blocker. 
Velocity Chart: Sprint 1 velocity established at 21 SP. 
Board Progress: Reflected realistic flow of To Do → In Progress → Done. 
(Placeholder: Insert board screenshots, burndown chart, velocity chart here once exported from Jira) 

Sprint Review 
Demoed: Signup, login/logout, and AI-generated questions with answer input. 
Stakeholder Feedback: 
Add Google login earlier than planned. 
Consider voice input for answers in a future sprint. 
Sprint Retrospective 

What went well: Authentication features integrated smoothly. 
What didn’t: API quota limits slowed down AI question delivery. 
Action items: Use mock APIs in early development phases to reduce dependency delays. 
Roadmap [Future sprints – Theoretical] 
Sprint 2 Goal: Enhance AI feedback and onboarding 

A3 = google login 
B3 = unique question every session 
C1 = AI feedback on answers 
E2 = landing page  
Sprint 3 Goal: Payments and full MVP readiness 

C2 = progress dashboard 
D1 = subscription system 
D2 = admin dashboard 
E1 = responsive web 
Agile Learnings 
Daily board updates improve reporting accuracy – burndown chart reflects real progress only if tasks are moved daily 
Blockers highlight risks – simulated API quota limits created a realistic impediment scenario 
Velocity established [21 SP] - will guide future sprint planning 
Scrum ceremonies matter – sprint review + retrospective gave structure to improvements
